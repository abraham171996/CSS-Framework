Custom CSS Framework

This Git repository contains a custom CSS framework that provides a set of reusable styles and mixins to simplify web development. The framework offers a collection of utility classes, layout components, and responsive breakpoints, allowing developers to rapidly build responsive and visually appealing websites.

Key Features:
- Mixins: The framework includes a variety of mixins to facilitate code reusability and promote consistency across the project. Mixins such as `alert`, `button`, `card`, `navbar`, and more, provide ready-to-use styles and configurations for common UI elements.
- Responsive Breakpoints: The framework incorporates a responsive design approach by providing breakpoints at various screen sizes. Developers can utilize the `mq` mixin to create media queries based on the defined breakpoints, ensuring the website's responsiveness across different devices.
- Grid System: The framework includes a flexible grid system that enables the creation of responsive layouts. The `row` and `col` mixins allow developers to easily structure content within a grid, offering control over column widths and alignment.
- Styling Helpers: The framework provides a range of styling helpers, such as text colors, border radii, image styling, headings, and z-index classes. These helpers can be used to quickly apply consistent styles to elements throughout the website.

Repository Structure:
- mixins.scss: Contains various mixins for reusable styles and configurations.
- variables.scss: Defines global variables for colors, breakpoints, and other customizable options.
- grid.scss: Implements the grid system for creating responsive layouts.
- helpers.scss: Includes styling helpers for text colors, border radii, images, headings, and z-indexes.
